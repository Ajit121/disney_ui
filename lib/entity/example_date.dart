        'Sadness is literally the very definition and being of sorrow and gloom. She was hardly ever used because Joy is the dominant emotion and didn\'t want Riley to ever be sad. Because of this, Joy treated Sadness poorly. Secretly however, Sadness yearned to earn her place among the other emotions, even though the others did not believe Sadness had a purpose in the mind and almost always prevented her from trying. She is the most sensitive out of all the emotions, as she felt genuinely hurt by Joy\'s desertion because, "Riley needs to be happy", which made Sadness feel she was truly useless.',

        description:
        'Judy is fiercely optimistic and independent. Since childhood, she has harbored a dream to become a police officer, solely for the opportunity to help those in need and make the world a better place. She cares deeply for the well-being of others; this includes her family, friends, Mrs. Otterton\'s despair over the disappearance of her husband, and even Nick. During the chase in Little Rodentia, Judy intercepted every chance of danger for the small residents even when capturing the thieving Duke Weaselton was on the line. She has a big heart, and although she tends to keep her emotions under control - and even under wraps - a majority of the time, she is capable of expressing her true feelings in a genuine, powerful light. This is mostly seen with Nick Wilde, whose feelings and companionship she values highly, motivating her to prevent her own ambitions from harming others.',

        'In line with her programmed age, Vanellope is extremely energetic, talkative, and childish. When excited, she zestfully zips and bounces around while repeatedly exclaiming the reasoning behind her excitement ("I\'m gonna learn to drive, I\'m gonna learn to drive!"), much like a normal child. She has a rather immature sense of humor (finding enjoyment in mimicking and toilet humor) and has the tendency to purposely annoy those around her as a means to amuse herself. This is seen through her friendship with Ralph, as the two are known to give each other puerile, condescending nicknames.',
